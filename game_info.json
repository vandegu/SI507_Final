Initial placement of the item can be either predetermined or random. The delivery of the good usually gives the player money to do more actions with. In most cases, there is a game rule or another mechanic that determines where the item needs to go.", "Simulation": "Simulation games are games that attempt to model actual events or situations.", "Worker Placement": "More precisely referred to as \"action drafting\", this mechanism requires players to select individual actions from a set of actions available to all players. Players generally select actions one-at-a-time and in turn order. There is usually(*) a limit on the number of times a single action may be taken. Once that limit for an action is reached, it typically either becomes more expensive to take again or can no longer be taken for the remainder of the round. As such, not all actions can be taken by all players in a given round, and action \"blocking\" occurs. If the game is structured in rounds, then all actions are usually refreshed at the start or end of each round so that they become available again.", "Area Movement": "Area movement means that the game board is divided into areas *of varying size* which can be moved out of or into in any direction as long as the areas are adjacent or connected.  A classic example being Axis & Allies, in which land and water are divided into variable areas and boundaries that define connectivity between various areas.", "Rock-Paper-Scissors": "Rock-Paper-Scissors can fall into a subcategory of Simultaneous Action Selection or Trick-Playing. However, simultaneity is not the most defining quality. Turn-about games also frequently employ this mechanism.", "Area Enclosure": "In Area Enclosure games, players place or move pieces in order to surround as much area as possible with their pieces.  The oldest and most famous Area Enclosure game is of course Go, but many newer examples also exist.", "Card Drafting": "Card drafting games are games in which players pick cards from a limited subset, such as a common pool, to gain some advantage (immediate or longterm) or to assemble hands of cards that are used to meet objectives within the game. Saint Petersburg is a well-known card drafting game.", "Pattern Building": "Pattern Building is a system where players place game components in specific patterns in order to gain specific or variable game results.  For example: placing chips on 2, 4, 6, 8 on a board gets the player an action card they can use later in the game.", "Stock Holding": "Stock holding is a subcategory of Commodity Speculation, in which instead of purchasing or selling an entire commodity, players purchase and sell (or hold) a share in a given company, commodity or nation.", "Player Elimination": "Player elimination occurs in multiple-player games (>2) when a player can be eliminated from the game and play continues without the eliminated player. The typical examples of games that provides elimination are Diplomacy or Risk (where a player may be defeated) or Monopoly (where a player may go bankrupt and thus be eliminated). There are also games where achieving the win condition will eliminate you from the game and the last person remaining is the loser. An example for this would be Palace.", "Partnerships": "Games with partnerships offer players a set of rules for alliances and teams. Partners are often able to win as a team, or penalities are enforced for not respecting alliances.", "Tile Placement": "Tile Placement games feature placing a piece to score VPs, with the amount often based on adjacent pieces or pieces in the same group/cluster, and keying off non-spatial properties like color, \"feature completion\", cluster size etc.", "Variable Phase Order": "Variable Phase Order implies that turns may not be played the same way as before and / or after.", "Voting": "Voting allows players to influence the outcome of certain events within the game.  The vote may be all or nothing, choosing a target for an effect, or to determine the results of certain situations.  Players\u2019 votes may not have equal weight, and blocking a player from voting can be a valid tactic.", "Point to Point Movement": "On a board of a game with point-to-point movement, there are certain spots that can be occupied by markers or figurines, e. g. cities on a map. These points are connected by lines, and movement can only happen along these lines. It is not enough that two points are next to or close to each other; if there is no connecting line between them, a player cannot move his or her piece from one to the other.", "Time Track": "A time track mechanism is a variable player-turn order mechanism by which the player who is last on the time track goes next.  The function of this mechanism can allow a player to have multiple sequential turns due to being last after each one. The basic premise is that you can choose to do a longer, slower task in the game, but in the meantime, a player taking shorter, quicker actions might change the \"landscape\" of the playfield. It is arguably a derivative of \"action point\" systems, except in the case of time tracks, the player doesn't have a fixed number of points she can or must use on her turn.", "Role Playing": "Some board games incorporate elements of role playing. It can be that players control a character that improves over time. It can also be a game that encourages or inspires Storytelling. This mechanic can be viewed as an extension of Variable Player Powers.", "Deck / Pool Building": "Deck building/Pool building refers to a collection of related mechanisms. Players have a personal pool, or collection, of cards or tokens, that provide different actions and/or resources. A subset of those cards/tokens are randomly drawn each turn. An important aspect of the game lies in managing the contents of that pool by adding and removing cards and tokens over the course of the gameplay, often through the very actions provided by the cards/tokens themselves. Over time, players build decks/pools that are more and more specialized and effective towards some purpose(s), typically including claiming victory objectives. Deck/pool-building may be the central mechanism of a game, or it may be one part of a larger system.", "Grid Movement": "The Grid Movement occurs when pawns move on the grid in many directions. Usually the grid is square (like in Chess) or hexagonal (Abalone).", "Commodity Speculation": "Commodity Speculation is a subcateogry of Betting/Wagering, in which in-game money is bet on different commodities in hope that that particular commodity will become the most valuable as the game progresses.  Often the values of the commodities are continually changing throughout the game, and the players buy and sell the commodities to make money off of their investment.", "Cooperative Play": "Co-operative play encourages or requires players to work together to beat the game. There is little or no competition between players. Either the players win the game by reaching a pre-determined objective, or all players lose the game, often by not reaching the objective before a certain event happens.", "Hex-and-Counter": "Classic wargame mechanic, played with 'Counters' on a map with an Hexagonal grid allowing to move the counters in more directions (6) as opposed to a square grid with only four directions.", "Betting/Wagering": "Betting/Wagering games are games that encourage or require players to bet money (real or in-game) on certain outcomes within the game. The betting itself becomes part of the game. This mechanic is most commonly associated with Poker.", "Take That": "Maneuvers that directly attack an opposing player's strength, level, life points or do something else to impede their progress, while usually providing the main engine for player interaction in the game.  Usually used in card games.  Mille Bornes is a good example.  Munchkin or Give Me The Brain! could also be considered to use variants of this mechanic, where single unforeseen card plays can cause huge swings in player progress or power.", "Set Collection": "The primary goal of a set collection mechanic is to encourage a player to collect a set of items. For example, players collect and harvest different types of beans in Bohnanza, and they collect Monuments in Ra.", "Area Control / Area Influence": "The Area Control mechanic typically awards control of an area to the player that has the majority of units or influence in that area. As such, it can be viewed as a sub-category of Auction/Bidding in that players can up their \"bids\" for specific areas through the placement of units or meeples.", "Line Drawing": "Games using the line drawing mechanic involve the drawing of lines in one way or another. Lines may be used to connect objects as in Sprouts, to isolate objects, or to create areas as in the classic Dots and Dashes, also known as Square-it.", "Hand Management": "Hand management games are games with cards in them that reward players for playing the cards in certain sequences or groups. The optimal sequence/grouping may vary, depending on board position, cards held and cards played by opponents. Managing your hand means gaining the most value out of available cards under given circumstances. Cards often have multiple uses in the game, further obfuscating an \"optimal\" sequence.", "Modular Board": "Play occurs upon a modular board that is composed of multiple pieces, often tiles or cards.", "Dice Rolling": "Dice rolling is a game by itself see Yahtzee or Craps but as a game mechanic dice rolling in a game can be used for many things, randomness being the most obvious. Dice can also be used as counters; start at 6 (for a normal die: singular for dice) and turn it to 5 at the end of a round, single player's turn etc. The dice themselves can be unique and different sizes, shapes and colors to represent different things.", "Memory": "Games that use the Memory mechanic require players to recall previous game events or information in order to reach an objective.", "Press Your Luck": "Games where you repeat an action (or part of an action) until you decide to stop due to increased (or not) risk of losing points or your turn. Press Your Luck games include both Risk Management and Risk Valuation games, in which risk is driven by the game mechanisms and valuing how much other players value what you also want, respectively.\nThis mechanic is also called push your luck.", "Auction/Bidding": "This mechanic requires you to place a bid, usually monetary, on items in an auction of goods in order to enhance your position in the game. These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to Worker Placement, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.", "Paper-and-Pencil": "The game is developed using paper and pen to mark and save responses or attributes that, at the end of the game, are used to score points and determine the winner.", "Action Point Allowance System": "In Action Point (AP) Allowance System games, each player is allotted a certain amount of points per round. These points can be spent on available actions, until the player does not have enough remaining to \"purchase\" any more actions. This method grants the player greater freedom over how to execute his or her options. Pandemic is an example of a game that uses this mechanic. In Pandemic, players are given 4 action points to be allocated between several actions: Movement, Air Travel, Special Action, and Special Ability.", "Trading": "In games with a trading mechanic, the players can exchange game items between each other. For instance, players trade for different types of beans in Bohnanza, while they trade resources in Catan.", "Storytelling": "In storytelling games, players are provided with conceptual, written, or pictorial stimuli which must be incorporated into a story of the players' creation. Once Upon a Time uses a selection of words while Rory's Story Cubes include ambiguous symbols. Some games like Snake Oil and Big Idea prompt players to pitch a product, which frequently takes the form of a brief story or vignette.", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven": "The Campaign/Battle Card Driven mechanic is a relatively recent development in wargames that focuses the players' actions on cards they have in their hand. The very basic idea is that performing a single action uses a single card. Games where cards are used to determine the outcome of battles do not use this mechanic.", "Roll / Spin and Move": "Roll / Spin and move games are games where players roll dice or spin spinners and move playing pieces in accordance with the roll.", "Variable Player Powers": "Variable Player Powers is a mechanic that grants different abilities and/or paths to victory to the players.  To illustrate, here are some notable examples.", "Action / Movement Programming": "In programming, every player must secretly choose and commit their moves for the next 'n' turns. Then each player plays their turns out according to the choices made. The key to Action / Movement Programming is that all players choose and lock in their actions, prior to anyone executing any of their actions. Once all of the actions are locked in, then an execution phase occurs where all of the previously locked in actions are executed. This mechanism relies heavily on a player planning several moves ahead and anticipating what other players, or the game will do that may affect the actions chosen. Often this results in things going spectacularly or amusingly wrong, because the status of the game changed in ways one did not anticipate, or hoped would not happen, before the action is executed. Conversely when a complex series of pre-programmed actions works exactly as anticipated the player's feeling of accomplishment is quite high which makes this both a very frustrating, and very gratifying mechanic.", "Route/Network Building": "Route/Network Building games feature network(s) (interconnected lines with nodes) using owned, partially owned or neutral pieces, with an emphasis on building the longest chain and/or connecting to new areas. Although arguably a separate group, Connection games, in which players connect fixed points on the board, are also included among Route/Network Building games.", "Area-Impulse": "Players subdivide turns into impulses alternating between players which repeat until both players pass (or in some cases a sunset die roll ends the impulses catching one or both players off guard).  In those impulses a group of units is once activated or gets to act collectively before being marked spent. However instead of the activated units being grouped by a certain radius from a leader the units activated are in an area (and thus the need for the impulse system to have areas, not hexes).  The areas exist to define scope of activation on an impulse (as well as restrict what can be done on that impulse with respect to attack and movement range). Thus each of a players groups of units each acts once by means of small alternating impulses instead of the traditional all my units then all your units. Finally before the next turn of impulses spent units are reset regaining the ability to act.", "Trick-taking": "Trick Taking is a game mechanism used in card games.", "Simultaneous Action Selection": "The simultaneous action selection mechanic lets players secretly choose their actions. After they are revealed, the actions resolve following the ruleset of the game.", "Secret Unit Deployment": "Secret unit deployment games are games that contain hidden information. Only the player controlling certain playing pieces has perfect information about the nature (or even the whereabouts) of those pieces. This mechanic is often used in wargames to simulate \"fog of war\".", "Pattern Recognition": "Markers, usually with a color or pattern, are placed or added on different random or pre-determined locations relative to a board or the markers themselves. As the markers move during play the player has to recognize a known pattern created by the markers to gain a good, points or win the game."}}
